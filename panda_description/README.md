## Instructions

### URDF

For URDF, [panda.urdf.xacro](./urdf/panda.urdf.xacro) is the primary descriptor that includes all other xacros and creates a model based on the passed arguments. To generate URDF out of xacro, you can use the included [xacro2urdf.bash](./scripts/xacro2urdf.bash) script and modify its arguments as needed. Once executed, [panda.urdf](./urdf/panda.urdf) will automatically be replaced. Alternatively, `xacro panda.urdf.xacro name:="panda" <arg_i>:=<val_i> ...` can be executed directly, e.g. this is preferred within any launch script.

In order to visualise URDF with RViz2, included [view.launch.py](./launch/view.launch.py) script can be used.

```bash
ros2 launch panda_description view.launch.py
```

### SDF

For SDF, please use the included [xacro2sdf.bash](./scripts/xacro2sdf.bash) script with the desired arguments. This script makes sure that a correct relative path is used to locate all assets.

To visualise SDF with Gazebo, included [view_ign.launch.py](./launch/view_ign.launch.py) script can be used.

```bash
ros2 launch panda_description view_ign.launch.py
```

#### Fuel

If you do not require URDF and other resources from this repository, the default model (without `ros2_control`) can also be included directly from [Fuel](https://app.gazebosim.org/AndrejOrsula/fuel/models/panda) if you do not require the URDF description.

```xml
<include>
    <uri>https://fuel.gazebosim.org/1.0/AndrejOrsula/models/panda</uri>
</include>
```

## Disclaimer

Several of the included xacros and meshes originated in [frankaemika/franka_ros](https://github.com/frankaemika/franka_ros/tree/develop/franka_description). These files were modified to fit the purpose of this repository, e.g. xacros were refactored, inertial properties were estimated, support for `ros2_control` was added, mesh geometry was remodelled to improve performance, ...

## Directory Structure

The following directory structure is utilised for this package because it provides compatibility with Gazebo, including [Fuel](https://app.gazebosim.org).
