# panda_moveit_config

MoveIt configuration for Franka Emika Panda.

## Instructions

### move_group

In order to configure and setup `move_group` of MoveIt 2 to plan motions inside a simulation (real robot is not yet supported), [move_group.launch.py](./launch/move_group.launch.py) script can be launched or included in another launch script.

```bash
ros2 launch panda_moveit_config move_group.launch.py <arg_i>:=<val_i>
```

To see all arguments, please use `ros2 launch --show-args panda_moveit_config move_group.launch.py`.

### SRDF

For SRDF, [panda.srdf.xacro](./srdf/panda.srdf.xacro) is the primary descriptor that includes all other xacros and creates a configuration based on the passed arguments. To generate SRDF out of xacro, you can use the included [xacro2srdf.bash](./scripts/xacro2srdf.bash) script and modify its arguments as needed. Once executed, [panda.srdf](./srdf/panda.srdf) will automatically be replaced. Alternatively, `xacro panda.srdf.xacro name:="panda" <arg_i>:=<val_i> ...` can be executed directly, e.g. this is preferred within any launch script.

## Examples

### fake_control

To see if everything works in an isolated environment, try using [ex_fake_control.launch.py](./launch/ex_fake_control.launch.py) script that allows planning motions with MoveIt 2 and executing them with fake controllers inside RViz2.

```bash
ros2 launch panda_moveit_config ex_fake_control.launch.py
```

### ign_control

Example of using Franka Emika Panda inside Ignition Gazebo is provided by [ex_ign_control.launch.py](./launch/ex_ign_control.launch.py) script that allows planning motions with MoveIt 2 inside Gazebo via RViz2.

```bash
ros2 launch panda_moveit_config ex_ign_control.launch.py
```
